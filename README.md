# Memories_From_Childhood
Just found these code files lying around in the draft of my mailbox. I wrote these codes as a 15 year old kid and looking at these codes (especially the 2000-liner banking app code) brings back a lot of memories and a smile upon my face, and reminds me how each of these projects has a story behind it. Putting them here so I won't lose them again.
